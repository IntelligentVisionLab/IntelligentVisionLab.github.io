<!-- ## Capsule Networks With Capsule-Type Normalization Routing -->
Abstract—Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have been well known
for its part-whole relational property, whilst with heavy computation of the capsule routing. The classic Expectation-Maximization
(EM) capsule routing first compute the vote matrix by multiplying part-whole pose matrix and learnable weight matrix, and
secondly fed vote matrices and activations into EM algorithm
for clustering. The heavy computation comes from a large-scale
computations of vote matrices and large-scale data EM cluster.
To address the challenge of lightweight design of CapsNets,
different from the previous EM capsule routing that obeys the
first-vote-then-cluster rule, we implement a novel first-cluterthen-vote mechanism. To this end, in this paper, we develop a
capsule-type normalization routing algorithm as illustrated in
Fig. 1 (b). Specifically, we first normalize the part-level capsules
along the type dimension with the aim of transforming all types
of capsules into a uniform distribution. Secondly, all part-level
capsules and their mixed capsules are voted to the whole-level
capsules via a multiplication with a single transformable matrix.
In such way, the cluster computation and matrix multiplication
computation both get reduced with a large margin. Our capsuletype normalization routing builds a deep CapsNets, which are
proved to be promising on multiple datasets, including MNIST,
SVHN, SmallNORB, CIFAR-10/100. Notably, our CapsNets can
be implemented on the large-scale ImageNet-1K dataset and
beats ResNets, which is quite difficult for the previous CapsNets
versions.
